# Computer methods for astrodynamics üöÄ

This repository holds an open-source book that covers in detail all the topics
related with astrodynamics, orital-mechanics and astronomy. My intention
writing this book is to share all the knowledge that I have adquired during the
last years on all previous topics while making a small contribution to the
open-source community.

## Style of the book üìï

I would like to mantain a standard style along the book. All drawings and figures
should be embraced by a thick blakc line. Furthermore, drawings should be as
simple as they can: stylish fine black lines, elegant text if required and
no-coloured figures.

Once a new figure is designed, the *.svg and the *.png files with same file name
should be included in the `figs/` folder.

## How to contribute üñ•Ô∏è

Contributions are always welcome, since writing a book alone is a tedious work.
New contributors should have a minimum knowledge on LaTeX or Inkscape, depending
if they want to write or add new figures/designs to the book.

Procedure to add your contribution is very simple:

1. Fork the repo and then clone it to your local machine
2. Create a new branch, add new content and push your changes
3. Finally open a new pull-request to the official repo
4. Once merged, celebrate your new contribution

Your changes will be added in furhter versions/releases of the book.
